   <b> Kolhapur is one of the most significant cities in South Maharashtra and has been a hub of historical, 
    religious, and cultural activities for centuries. It is famous for its unique food culture, including 
    its signature Kolhapuri cuisine.

    The city is situated in the western part of Maharashtra and is often
    referred to as "Dakshin Kashi" or "Mahateerth". It boasts a rich history, which has given it various
    other names, including Kollagiri, Kolladigiripattan and Kollpur, all meaning "valley" [citation needed  
    Around 2 CE Kolhapur's name was 'Kuntal'.[1]

      Kolhapur is named after Kolhasur, a demon in Hindu History.[9] According to legend
             the demon Kolhasur renounced asceticism after his sons were killed by the gods for harassing people.
        He prayed to Mahalakshmi, requesting that she leave the area to him for a hundred years.
    
        He committed numerous crimes during this period until the goddess returned after the hundred years
          were over and killed him for his sins.[10][11] Kolhasur's dying wish was to name the place after him,
           a request granted, and the area was named Kolhapur. 
      'Kolha' represents Kolhasur, and 'pur,' a Sanskrit word, means 'city.'[11]</b>

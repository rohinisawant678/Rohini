        Pune, with its rich historical and cultural heritage, has experienced the reign of the Rashtrakutas, Satavahanas, and Yadava dynasties. 
        The foundation of the city's establishment was laid by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Rajmata Jijabai. 
        The Peshwas also made significant contributions to the development of Pune. 
        After the downfall of the Peshwa Empire in 1818, the British took control of Pune and its surrounding areas.
         In 1858, after the establishment of the Municipal Corporation, urban infrastructure was developed in the city.


The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) was established in 1950 in the culturally and historically significant city of Pune.

In the following years, particularly after the devastating Panshet flood of 1962, the corporation efficiently and diligently undertook the task of restoring normalcy.

In the subsequent years, PMC played a crucial role in the city's rapid development, ensuring essential services such as water supply, roads, electricity, primary healthcare, and education while preserving its historical heritage. To promote tourism and safeguard the city's rich legacy, the Heritage Management Department was established. This department has successfully undertaken and completed several significant projects and has compiled a comprehensive list of the city's historical sites.
